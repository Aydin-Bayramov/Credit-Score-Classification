## üåü Introduction

Credit scoring plays a critical role in financial decision-making, impacting loans, credit card approvals, and more. This project aims to:

- Predict credit scores (`Good`, `Standard`, or `Poor`) using machine learning models.
- Understand key factors influencing credit scores through data analysis and feature importance.
- Provide a reproducible pipeline for future credit score projects.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
- **EDA and Visualizations**: Gain insights through descriptive statistics and plots.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements `RandomForestClassifier` with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Reproducibility**: Modular codebase with detailed instructions.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA highlights patterns and relationships in the data. Key visualizations include:

- **Credit Score Distribution**: Understand the balance across score categories.
- **Income vs. Credit Score**: Analyze the impact of annual income on scores.
- **Credit History Analysis**: Examine the role of credit history length.

## üß™ Model Training and Evaluation

### Model: Random Forest Classifier

Key steps include:

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Performed using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
2. **Cross-Validation**: Ensures robust performance metrics.

#### Best Hyperparameters
- `n_estimators`: 300
- `max_depth`: 20
- `min_samples_split`: 10
- `min_samples_leaf`: 5

#### Evaluation Metrics

| Metric      | Training Precision | Testing Precision |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| `Good`      | 0.83               | 0.73              |
| `Standard`  | 0.86               | 0.79              |
| `Poor`      | 0.89               | 0.83              |

Overall Test Accuracy: **80%**
